</header>

<main>
  <p>
    This is a digital service that is activated immediately after successful payment.
  </p>

  <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
  <p>
    Once premium access has been successfully activated, the transaction is considered complete
    and is generally non-refundable.
  </p>

  <h2>Cancellations</h2>
  <p>
    Users may stop using the service at any time. Unused time or partial usage does not qualify
    for refunds.
  </p>

  <h2>Technical Issues</h2>
  <p>
    If payment is successful but access is not provided due to a technical issue, users must
    contact support within 48 hours for resolution.
